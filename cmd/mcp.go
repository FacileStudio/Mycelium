		"Tools: search_memory, list_flows, run_flow, and publish_artifact. An agent launches this as a " +
		"subprocess and speaks JSON-RPC over its stdin and stdout, so nothing here prints to " +
		"the terminal.\n\n" +
		"Stdio, not a URL: run_flow executes shell commands on this machine, and the pin " +
		"deciding which flows may run is per machine. A human still has to accept each flow " +
		"with \"mycelium flow trust <name>\" before an agent can run it.",
