// MCP servers are abused, and a fixed set of procedures a human read and pinned

// would hand that back. DestructiveHint and OpenWorldHint are both true because
// a flow's steps are arbitrary shell commands that may reach anything.

// Those annotations still only shape a prompt. The spec requires clients to
// treat them as untrusted, so the pin checked in trust.go is the real gate.
