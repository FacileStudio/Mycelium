// Package mcpserver exposes mycelium's wiki, its recorded flows and its report
// store to an agent
// as MCP tools, spoken over stdio.
//
// Stdio is not a default here, it is the only transport that can work. run_flow
// executes "sh -c" on the calling machine, and the pin deciding whether it may
// lives in ~/.mycelium/.flow-trust.json, which is per machine on purpose. The
// 2026-07-28 spec agrees: a server "intending ... to be run locally SHOULD ...
// use the stdio transport to limit access to just the MCP client".
//
// Every tool declares its annotations explicitly, and every one of them is a
// hint the client may ignore: the spec requires clients to "consider tool
// annotations to be untrusted". They shape a permission prompt and nothing
// else. The gate that actually stops a flow from running is the trust pin,
// which runFlow checks through flow.IsTrusted before it starts anything.
